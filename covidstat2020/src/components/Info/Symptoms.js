                <p>Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus 
                    (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection with <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2928832/' without rel="noopener noreferrer"  target="_blank"><b>influenza viruses.</b> </a>Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, 
                    it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. 
                    Flu and COVID-19 share many characteristics, but there are some key differences between the two.
                    <br /><br />While more is learned every day, there is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and the virus that causes it. 
                    <br />This <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm' without rel="noopener noreferrer"  target="_blank">table</a> compares COVID-19 and flu, given the best available information to date.
